# Heart Disease Predictor

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using AI techniques and clinical features. The objective is to develop an accurate predictive model for early detection and diagnosis of heart disease.

## Project Overview

The project leverages AI techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical features. It aims to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and treatment plans.

## Objective

The main objectives of the project are:

- Preprocess and analyze clinical data to enhance quality and standardize features.
- Develop machine learning models using scikit-learn to predict heart disease.
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics and compare their performance.
- Visualize results and provide insights for interpretation.

## Technologies Used

- Python and scikit-learn for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- Flask for building a web application.
- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib for data visualization.
- NumPy for numerical operations.

## Data Preprocessing

- Analyze and clean clinical data.
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- One-hot encode categorical features.

## AI Models Used

The project employs a machine learning model for heart disease prediction:

- Random Forest Classifier

## Web Application (app.py)

The project includes a Flask web application to interact with the predictive model. Users can input clinical data and receive predictions about the likelihood of heart disease.

## Model Creation (model.py)

The heart disease prediction model is created using clinical data, and the Random Forest Classifier is used for modeling.
